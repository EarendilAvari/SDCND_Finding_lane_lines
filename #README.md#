# Self driving car nanodegree
## Project 1: Finding lane lines

### Description

This is the first project of the Udacity's nanodegree in autonomous vehicles. In this project concepts of computer vision are used in order to detect lines on the street through a camera. For that the library OpenCV is used.

For the project a pipeline of functions was developed to be applied first in images and after that in videos. 

### Development process

The pipeline was developed first within the Jupyter Notebook "SDCND_Project1.ipynb" with the image "solidWhiteCurve.jpg".
